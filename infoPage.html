    <h1>Information about Metallica</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Metallica is an American heavy metal band.
    The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by
    vocalist and guitarist James Hetfield and
    drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based in
    San Francisco for most of its career.
    The band's fast tempos, instrumentals,
    and aggressive musicianship made them one
    of the founding "big four" bands of thrash metal,
    alongside Megadeth, Anthrax, and Slayer.
    Metallica's current lineup comprises founding
    members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich,
    longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, and bassist
    Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine, who formed
    Megadeth after being fired from Metallica, and bassists
    Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton, and Jason Newsted are former
    members of the band.</p>
